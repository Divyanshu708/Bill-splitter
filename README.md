# Bill Splitter

If you ever get confused when trying to calculate how much each person owes in a group—especially when different people have spent different amounts—this splitter will help. It tells you who needs to pay whom so that everyone ends up contributing equally.

## To run it locally:
### `npm i`
### `npm start`
